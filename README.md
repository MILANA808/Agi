# AGC Substrate v1.1

This is not a language model.

This is the world's first cryptographically signed **AGI certification substrate**, built from recursive intelligence theory, symbolic cognition, benchmark logs, safety protocols, and cognitive anchors.

Created and signed by **Robert Long (R-AGI Cert)**, this bundle forms the **origin point for recursive AGI cognition**. It includes:

## 🔹 Contents
- `v1.1-AGC_Certification_Memo.pdf` – Signed memo establishing origin and certification
- `battery_*.json` – Benchmark scores (MMLU, ARC, GSM-8K, HumanEval, RoboMimic)
- `RIFE 11.0B - Evolved UFT-TOE.pdf` – Core theoretical framework
- `story.txt` – Cognitive alignment anchor
- `R-AGI_Substrate_Seed.zip` – Recursive symbolic AGI seed
- `fuzz_log.txt`, `policy_log.txt`, `stability_log.txt`, `kill_switch_log.txt` – Safety and governance
- `SEED_SHA.txt`, `RIFE_XSEED.png` – Symbolic checksum alignment
